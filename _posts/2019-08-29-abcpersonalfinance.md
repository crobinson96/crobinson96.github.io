I have recently been asked on a few occasions what I do, upon replying "I work in a finance company" I usually get asked on advice for investments. I go on to explain how I am not in an investing/trading type of role then, out of curiousity, I ask for a deeper insight into how the person manages their money. On almost all occassions I find out they are lacking basic personal finance skills, so I've decided to write this short article to demistify the basics of personal finance and give some actionable information instead of the typical philosophical answers given by many online. I am unsure if it is a universal financial illiteracy problem or just amongst the graduates I have met, but as I am a graduate myself I will write from the point of view of a graduate looking to get their personal finance in order.

## The state of the nation

It is quite common to find people who have never had an income every month at university to spend lavishly as if too make up for lost time. Find out what your current situation is by analysing your income and outgoings, typically app-based banking provide good breakdowns of your spending and for some this can be a shock to how much money you are really spending. As spending is very circumstancial to each person I won't waste time lecturing about your spending habits, rather I will give you a few common mistakes to avoid before proceeding to the next sections. Using Tim Ferris' idea of a ["not to do list"](https://tim.blog/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/):

- Don't buy a new german car on finance, use cash and buy second-hand.
- Don't buy coffee from starbucks everyday.
- Don't buy lunch everyday.
- Don't buy rounds for random people in the bar.
- Don't buy anything you don't have 2 or more use cases for.

And so on, I hope you get the point. I will leave this section with a quote by Will Rogers, "Too many people spend money they haven't earned to buy things they don't want to impress people they don't like".

## The Beginner Road Map

Now you have assessed your personal situation you can decide how much money you can save/invest each month. The first mistake I see a lot of people do is try to save or invest whilst still in debt (not including student loans), such as credit cards, car loans, personal loans etc. The reason this is a mistake is that the interest is A LOT higher on these debts than anything you can make investing. I honestly think for graduates this shouldn't be too much of an issue as you probably don't have the credit score to borrow much cash at university. Now we can go through the road map on what to do with the cash you want to save:

### 1. Get 3-6 months of expenses saved as an emergency fund.

Life feels comfortable when you're covered for the worst case scenario, eg. losing a job, car engine breaks. Some people reccomend getting more than 6 months expenses but as a graduate I think 3-6 months is fine, if you were trying to start your own business I would aim for more. Use a separate savings account for this money.

### 2. Max out your employers pension matching scheme (if there is one).

If you are lucky enough to have an employer matching scheme for pension contributions then take full advantage of it. It is literally free money you are throwing away if you don't. If you aren't fortunate to have one of these schemes I would strongly consider investing into a pension, probably anywhere from 5-10% of your pre-tax salary would be a good target. Some reccomend dividing your age when you start your pension by 2 and using that as your contribution %, eg. 22 y/o would invest 11% of pre-tax income. Reducing your tax bill with pension contributions is extremely efficient (especially for top-tier tax payers) and I doubt this luxury will be around forever so make the most of it while you can.

This is where the left over cash saving can get blurry based on personal circumstances, for most I'd assume they want to save to buy a house in the long-term so I will go over some ideas around that now.

### 3. Open a LISA (or a help to buy)

Any ISA is just a savings account (or stocks & shares account) that has a tax-free wrapper on the interest. A LISA is the same except with the added bonus of 25% on any contributions up to £4000 every tax-year until you are 50, although with a con that you cannot take the money out without penalty unless you take it out for retirement (age 55) or when buying your FIRST house. A help-to-buy is an ISA that also pays 25% on contributions on £1200 when opening the account and max. £200 a month thereafter up to £12,000. This means that if you can afford to save more than £200 a month then it is worthwhile going for the LISA (the LISA also allows lump sum payments). Go and look in an area you might fancy to live in, check online for the house prices and divide the price by 10. This is probably the bare minimum you will need for a house deposit (not including fees and extra cash for any repairs or improvements).

### 4. Apply for a credit card

Only if you have self-contol do I reccomend this step. Get a basic credit card and set up a direct debit for it to be paid of IN FULL every month. This will help build your credit score for when applying for a mortgage, do not get roped into the perks and rewards of these cards as the interest charge trumps the perks all day every day.

### 5. Open a stocks and shares ISA.

If you don't want to save for a house and don't have any short-term goals, you may consider opening a stocks and shares ISA. It is usually reccomended to invest in some index fund because the risk is divserified, you hold a piece of all the companies instead of having all your eggs in one basket. Also don't try and time the market..it won't work. Just drip feed money into the account every month and come back to it in 5+ years time.

## Tips and tricks

I have a few tips that work well for me that I think you should try out:

### 1. Automate your savings

Set up a direct debit for the day after you get paid and send the amount you want to save to a savings account. This will work better than leaving the money in your current account in the hope that it will still be there at the end of the month.

### 2. Switch your current account

With the Current account switch service in place in the UK switching your current account is extremely easy. All you do is open a new current account and instruct them to switch your old account to the new one. They will transfer all your direct debits and even your salary to your new account. Quite often there are incentives for switching to the new bank (such as £150 cash), which for a graduate starting out is good if you view it as an interest payment on your salary being paid into a different account. 

### 3. Find the best rates

Quite often there are linked savings accounts to current accounts that let you save say £300 a month at a 5% interest. These are typically a lot better than other savings accounts on the market. Bare in mind though that you typically have to lock money away for this rate until the end of the year.

### 4. Use [www.moneysavingexpert.com](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com)

This website groups all the information about a wide range of financial products together, making it quick and easy to find the best products suited to your needs. In particular I would use it for their savings account section (easy access for emergency fund and linked savers otherwise), LISA accounts, Stocks and shares accounts and even their free guide documenting the first-time buyer process.

I hope some of these points have helped you, I tried to keep it brief as to not bore the ready with fine-details of each product. Just follow these basics before asking people for "investment" ideas and you will be fine.
