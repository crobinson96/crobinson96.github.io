I currently work in a global derivatives exchange on the Pricing and Valuations team, specifically dealing with the valuations of Interest-rate swaps and FX Options. The work is split between the operational nature of managing the curve generation process and research style work on the inner workings of such processes. 

I have enjoyed the work around researching and implementing the methods involved in a process such as generating yield curves for the valuation of interest rate swaps. It is a non-trivial task which can often seem more like an art than a science. I would enjoy a job which involved more of the technical aspect of my current role. This has persuaded me to create a roadmap in order to transition into such a role. 

The problem is that the world of Quantitative finance is vast and for the past two years I have failed to see the forest for the trees. In my experience, interviewers and recruiters want you to know the basics of mathematical finance wellrather than knowing a lot about a particular area. It is also apparent that many of the interviewers ask what they themselves have experience with. Hence, many practitioners ask questions either about their current work or past experiences such as what they learnt on a Master's in Financial Mathematics. I feel like this approach has some flaws as in my experience of interviewing for our team it is useful to ask what the canditidate knows about and see if you can learn something from them. Nevertheless, it seems like understanding and implementing a few models is necessary in order to pass the technical interviews.

Although I have read a few introductory financial mathematics books in the two years since graduating. I feel like I have not studied them to the level needed to perform well in an interview. Therefore I will over the next few months spend time studying the material needed using the blog to write-up and display my understanding.
